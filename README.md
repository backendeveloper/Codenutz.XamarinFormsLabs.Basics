# Codenutz.XamarinFormsLabs.Basics

This project is a set of simple demonstration and starter projects for Xamarin Forms Labs.

##Step 1 XAML, MVVM & IOC

The first solution has a basic Xamarin Forms Labs set-up with a XAML view, using the MVVM pattern. The solution also sets up IOC with the SimpleContainer, and makes use of the ViewFactory for creating the Views and ViewModels.

The set-up is complete for Android and iOS, although there is still and outstanding issue with Xamarin Forms Labs preventing Windows Phone from building.

###Features included

- Basic Set-up
- MVVM
- ViewModel base class
- ViewFactory
- SimpleContainer (for Inversion of Control / Resolver)
